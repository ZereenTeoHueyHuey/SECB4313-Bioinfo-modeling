# Course Synopsis ðŸ¥‡
The discipline of modelling and simulation is increasingly being applied to biological problems. The problems are ranging from kinetic responses of atoms, complex reactions of biochemical pathways, and temporal behaviors of the biological systems. In this course, students are exposed to the fundamentals of mathematical modeling for simulating the behaviors of biological systems. The knowledge on how the systems work will be implemented in technical applications, which will involve several domains including healthcare and biotechnology. The students also involve in a number of problem solving activities using modeling techniques that will lead them to the development of contributing the knowledge for the domains.
